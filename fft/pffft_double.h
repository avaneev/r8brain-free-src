/*
   PFFFT : a Pretty Fast FFT.

   This is basically an adaptation of the single precision fftpack
   (v4) as found on netlib taking advantage of SIMD instruction found
   on cpus such as intel x86 (SSE1), powerpc (Altivec), and arm (NEON).
   
   For architectures where no SIMD instruction is available, the code
   falls back to a scalar version.  

   Restrictions: 

   - 1D transforms only, with 64-bit double precision.

   - supports only transforms for inputs of length N of the form
   N=(2^a)*(3^b)*(5^c), a >= 5, b >=0, c >= 0 (32, 48, 64, 96, 128,
   144, 160, etc are all acceptable lengths). Performance is best for
   128<=N<=8192.

   - all (double*) pointers in the functions below are expected to
   have an "simd-compatible" alignment, that is 32 bytes on x86 and
   powerpc CPUs.
  
   You can allocate such buffers with the functions
   pffft_aligned_malloc / pffft_aligned_free (or with stuff like
   posix_memalign..)

     filters whose impulse response is centered at t = 0 with the
     left-hand taps wrapped around to the end of the transform block:

     Layout caveat: the unordered REAL layout packs the two real-valued
     boundary coefficients F(0) and F(N/2) into the first lanes of the
     first two vectors, where F(N/2) occupies an otherwise-imaginary

     never with pffftd_zconvolve_scale() or pffftd_zconvolve(), which

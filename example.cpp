 * @brief An example C++ file that demonstrates resampler's usage.
 *
 * This is an example file which you won't be able to compile as it includes
 * some undisclosed program code. Please consider this example as a
 * pseudo-code demonstrating the use of the library. Here you can find an
 * example implementation of the simplest sample rate converter utility.

/**
 * @file r8bsrc.h
 *
 * @brief Inclusion file for use with the "r8bsrc.dll".
 *
 * This is the inclusion file for the "r8bsrc.dll" dynamic link library
 * (the "r8bsrc.lib" library should be included into the project). This DLL
 * is designed to be used on Windows, on a processor with SSE2 support.
 * On non-Windows systems it is preferrable to use the C++ library directly.
 *
 * Before using this DLL library please read the description of the
 * r8b::CDSPResampler class and its functions.
 *
 * Note that the "int" and "enum" types have 32-bit size on both 32-bit and
 * 64-bit systems. Pointer types, including the CR8BResampler type, have
 * 32-bit size on 32-bit system and 64-bit size on 64-bit system.

 * that will be passed to the resampler. The resampler relies on this value as
 * it allocates intermediate buffers. Input buffers longer than this value

 *
 * You do not need to allocate an intermediate output buffer for use with this
 * function. If required, the resampler will allocate a suitable intermediate
 * output buffer itself.
 *
 * @param ip0 Input buffer. This buffer may be used as output buffer by this
 * function.
 * @param l The number of samples available in the input buffer.
 * @param[out] op0 This variable receives the pointer to the resampled data.
 * This pointer may point to the address within the "ip0" input buffer, or to
 * *this object's internal buffer. In real-time applications it is suggested
 * to pass this pointer to the next output audio block and consume any data
 * left from the previous output audio block first before calling the
 * process() function again. The buffer pointed to by the "op0" on return may
 * be owned by the resampler, so it should not be freed by the caller.
 * @return The number of samples available in the "op0" output buffer. If the
 * data from the output buffer "op0" is going to be written to a bigger output
 * buffer, it is suggested to check the returned number of samples so that no
 * overflow of the bigger output buffer happens.
